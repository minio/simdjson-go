# simdjson-go

## Introduction

This is a Golang port of [simdjson](https://github.com/lemire/simdjson), 
a high performance JSON parser developed by Daniel Lemire and Geoff Langdale. 
It makes extensive use of SIMD instructions to achieve parsing performance of gigabytes of JSON per second.

Performance wise, `simdjson-go` runs on average at about 40% to 60% of the speed of simdjson. 
Compared to Golang's standard package `encoding/json`, `simdjson-go` is about 10x faster.

## Features

`simdjson-go` is a validating parser, meaning that it amongst others validates and checks numerical values, booleans etc.
 Therefore these values are available as the appropriate `int` and `float64` representations after parsing.

Additionally `simdjson-go` has the following features:

- No 4 GB object limit
- Support for [ndjson](http://ndjson.org/) (newline delimited json)
- Proper memory management
- Pure Go (no need for cgo)

## Performance vs simdjson

Based on the same set of JSON test files, the graph below shows a comparison between `simdjson` and `simdjson-go`.

![simdjson-vs-go-comparison](chart/simdjson-vs-simdjson-go.png)

These numbers were measured on a MacBook Pro equipped with a 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7. 
Also, to make it a fair comparison, the constant `GOLANG_NUMBER_PARSING` was set to `false` (default is `true`) 
in order to use the same number parsing function (which is faster at the expense of some precision; see more below). 

## Performance vs `encoding/json` and `json-iterator/go`

Below is a performance comparison to Golang's standard package `encoding/json` based on the same set of JSON test files.

## Usage 

Run the following command in order to install `simdjson-go`

```
$ go get github.com/minio/simdjson-go
```

In order to parse a JSON byte stream, you either call [`simdjson.Parse()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/minio/simdjson-go?tab=doc#Parse)
or [`simdjson.ParseND()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/minio/simdjson-go?tab=doc#ParseND) for newline delimited JSON files. 
Both of these functions return a [`ParsedJson`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/minio/simdjson-go?tab=doc#ParsedJson) 
struct that can be used to navigate the JSON object by calling [`Iter()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/minio/simdjson-go?tab=doc#ParsedJson.Iter). 

Using the type [`Iter`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/minio/simdjson-go?tab=doc#Iter) you can call 
[`Advance()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/minio/simdjson-go?tab=doc#Iter.Advance) to iterate over the tape, like so:

```
for {
    typ := iter.Advance()

    switch typ {
    case simdjson.TypeRoot:
        if typ, tmp, err = iter.Root(tmp); err != nil {
            return
        }

        if typ == simdjson.TypeObject {
            if obj, err = tmp.Object(obj); err != nil {
                return
            }

            e := obj.FindKey(key, &elem)
            if e != nil && elem.Type == simdjson.TypeString {
                v, _ := elem.Iter.StringBytes()
                fmt.Println(string(v))
            }
        }

    default:
        return
    }
}
```

More examples can be found in the examples subdirectory and further documentation can be found at [godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/minio/simdjson-go?tab=doc). 

## Requirements

`simdjson-go` has the following requirements:

- A CPU with both AVX2 and CLMUL is required (Haswell from 2013 onwards should do for Intel, for AMD a Ryzen/EPIC CPU (Q1 2017) should be sufficient). 
This can be checked using the provided [`SupportedCPU()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/minio/simdjson-go?tab=doc#SupportedCPU`) function.

## Design

`simdjson-go` follows the same two stage design as `simdjson`. 
During the first stage the structural elements (`{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `:`, and `,`) 
are detected and forwarded as offsets in the message buffer to the second stage. 
The second stage builds a tape format of the structure of the JSON document. 

Note that in contrast to `simdjson`, `simdjson-go` outputs `uint32` 
increments (as opposed to absolute values) to the second stage. 
This allows arbitrarily large JSON files to be parsed (as long as a single (string) element does not surpass 4 GB...). 

Also, for better performance, 
both stages run concurrently as separate go routines and a go channel is used to communicate between the two stages.

### Stage 1

Stage 1 has been converted from the original C code (containing the SIMD intrinsics) to Golang assembly using [c2goasm](https://github.com/minio/c2goasm). 
It essentially consists of five separate steps, being: 

- `find_odd_backslash_sequences`: detect backslash characters used to escape quotes
- `find_quote_mask_and_bits`: generate a mask with bits turned on for characters between quotes
- `find_whitespace_and_structurals`: generate a mask for whitespace plus a mask for the structural characters 
- `finalize_structurals`: combine the masks computed above into a final mask where each active bit represents the position of a structural character in the input message.
- `flatten_bits_incremental`: output the active bits in the final mask as incremental offsets.

For more details you can take a look at the various test cases in `find_subroutines_amd64_test.go` to see how 
the individual routines can be invoked (typically with a 64 byte input buffer that generates one or more 64-bit masks). 

There is one final routine, `find_structural_bits_in_slice`, that ties it all together and is 
invoked with a slice of the message buffer in order to find the incremental offsets.

### Stage 2

During Stage 2 the tape structure is constructed. 
It is essentially a single function that jumps around as it finds the various structural characters 
and builds the hierarchy of the JSON document that it processes. 
The values of the JSON elements such as strings, integers, booleans etc. are parsed and written to the tape.

Any errors (such as an array not being closed or a missing closing brace) are detected and reported back as errors to the client.

## Tape format

Similarly to `simdjson`, `simdjson-go` parses the structure onto a 'tape' format. 
With this format it is possible to skip over arrays and (sub)objects as the sizes are recorded in the tape. 

`simdjson-go` format is exactly the same as the `simdjson` [tape](https://github.com/lemire/simdjson/blob/master/doc/tape.md) 
format with the following 2 exceptions:

In order to support ndjson, it is possible to have many root elements on the tape. 
Also, to allow for fast navigation over root elements, 
a root points to the next root element (and as such the last root element points 1 index past the length of the tape).

Strings are handled differently, unlike `simdjson` the string size is not prepended in the String buffer 
but is added as an additional element to the tape itself (much like integers and floats). 
Only strings that contain special characters are copied to the String buffer 
in which case the payload from the tape is the offset into the String buffer. 
For string values without special characters the tape's payload points directly into the message buffer.

For more information, see `TestStage2BuildTape` in `stage2_build_tape_test.go`.

## Minor number inprecisions

The number parser has minor inprecisions compared to Golang's standard number parsing. 
There is constant `GOLANG_NUMBER_PARSING` (on by default) that uses Go's 
parsing functionality at the expense of giving up some performance. 
Note that the performance metrics mentioned above have been measured by setting the `GOLANG_NUMBER_PARSING` to `false`.

## Fuzz Tests

`simdjson-go` has been extensively fuzz tested to ensure that input cannot generate crashes and that output matches
the standard library.

The fuzzers and corpus are contained in a separate repository at [github.com/minio/simdjson-fuzz](https://github.com/minio/simdjson-fuzz)

The repo contains information on how to run them.
